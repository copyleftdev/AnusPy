# AnusPy

AnusPy is a revolutionary project at the crossroads of unconventional human-computer interaction and software design. The library transforms a series of kaggle clinches into corresponding character inputs, thus allowing the users to write source code in a truly novel manner.

This project aims to break barriers and redefine the conventional methods of interaction with computer systems, making coding more accessible and introducing a completely new way of expression.
